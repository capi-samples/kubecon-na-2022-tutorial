# Cluster Templates

**Objective:** Create a cluster template and use that to test creation of a cluster.

**Background:** Providers can supply templates (a.k.a flavors) that can be used to generate the manifests for a cluster. Templates must be in the **templates** folder of your providers repo. The default template will be in a file called **cluster-template.yaml** but you can created different named templates by naming the file using this format **cluster-template-myname.yaml** where **myname** can be anything you choose and that part becomes the template name. In this section we will be creating the default template.

## Create default template

1. Create a folder called **templates** in the root of your repo.
2. Create a file called **cluster-template.yaml** in the **templates** folder


## Test template
