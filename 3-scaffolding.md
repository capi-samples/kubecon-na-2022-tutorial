# Scaffolding

**Objective:** To create the initial project structure for our provider. Learn about the scaffolding tooling. NOTE: these steps are applicable to any operator you want to build.

1. Open your favourite terminal and go to `cluster-api-provider-docker` directory.
2. Run the following commands to scaffold the project

```shell=
kubebuilder init --domain  cluster.x-k8s.io --repo github.com/myname/cluster-api-provider-docker --project-version 3
```

3. Run the following commands to scaffold the API & controllers for the **DockerCluster** and **DockerMachine**, ensuring you answer **Y** to the following:
  a. Create Resource
  b. Create Controller
  
```shell!=
kubebuilder create api --group infrastructure --version v1alpha1 --kind DockerCluster
kubebuilder create api --group infrastructure --version v1alpha1 --kind DockerMachine
```

If you get the following error:
> `/usr/local/go/src/net/cgo_linux.go:12:8: no such package located`

Then you should install `gcc` and set the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable to 0 to disable cgo

4. Run the following commands:

```shell
make generate
make manifests
make build
```

5. Take a look at the generated code:
   1. `api/v1alpha1` folder contains the CRD definitions for your infrastructure cluster & machine
   2. `controllers` contains the controllers that will reconcile instances of your infrastructure CRDs
   3. `config` contains the Kubernetes artifacts that will be bundled together and used when deploying our provider

6. Make a change to `main.go` change the port for the **health-probe-bind-address** flag from `8081` to `9440`:

```go
flag.StringVar(&probeAddr, "health-probe-bind-address", ":9440", "The address the probe endpoint binds to.")
```

> This change is required as the liveness/readiness probes get generated using port 9440 but the code uses 8081 by default. If you don't change this then when you deploy the liveness and readiness probes will fail
